EpyTodo
Warning ⚠️

I want to specify that for this project,
I was a beginner in programming.
Moreover, I had never used JavaScript,
Despite this, I got 21/22 in the correction.
My missing point is that I forgot to set the foreign key in the SQL schema.
Description 🌄

The project idea is to build a Todo List.
Thanks to it, you’ll be able to handle all the tasks you need to do easily!
We will mainly focus on the “backend” side of the project,
but feel free to show us what you can by building a “frontend” to your project as a bonus.
Within this project, you’ll have to develop:
      1. your MySQL database.
      2. A web server using Node.js

Here is the architecture I set up for the project :

We also made a SQL script to create the database quickly :
